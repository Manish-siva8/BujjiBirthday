# For My Home, Keerthana.

There are 8 billion people in this world, and somehow, I got lucky enough to find the one person who makes everything sense.

You know I’m not usually this creative. I treat things with logic. But you? You are the one exception to my logic. You make me want to do things I’ve never done before—like building a whole website just to see you smile for a few seconds.

I wanted to give you something that isn't just a "gift," but a reminder. A reminder that whenever you feel low, or tired, or just need a break—you can come here and remember that you are so, so loved.
